What it does:

- Loads an image texture (e.g., fabric.jpg)
- Uses it to define the color of the surface
- The Principled BSDF handles light reflection, roughness, and more
- The result is sent to the renderer via Material Output

## 💡 Key Shader Tips

- Every material needs a **Material Output** node to render.
- Shader nodes can be connected to **Surface**, **Volume**, or **Displacement** slots.
- Use the **Shader Editor** workspace to build and edit materials visually.
- Preview your shaders in **Material Preview** or **Rendered** mode.
